# Satellite Data Processing Project: Deforestation Monitoring System

## Project Overview
This project will create an end-to-end deforestation monitoring system using satellite data (primarily Landsat and Sentinel-2), Apache Spark for distributed processing, and Python for analysis. The system will:

- Ingest raw satellite data
- Process and analyze vegetation indices
- Detect changes over time
- Generate alerts for significant deforestation events
- Visualize results

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective:
To build a scalable pipeline that ingests, processes, and analyzes satellite observation data (e.g., from EPS-SG or Sentinel), and computes statistics like daily average radiance, cloud cover, and data quality flags.

###  1. Environment Setup: Infrastructure Requirements
- Apache Spark 3.x cluster (can be local for development)
- Python 3.8+ with scientific stack
- GDAL and rasterio for geospatial processing
- PostgreSQL with PostGIS extension for storage

### 2. Data Ingestion Module 

### 3. Preprocessing Pipeline: Key Steps:
- Radiometric correction
- Atmospheric correction
- Cloud masking
- Band stacking
- Reprojection to common CRS

### 4. Vegetation Analysis Module

### 5. Change Detection Module 

### 6. Alert Generation System 

### 7. Visualization Module

### 8. Deployment Architecture

### 9. Cloud Deployment Option (AWS)
- **Data Storage:** S3 buckets organized by satellite/sensor and date
- **Processing:** EMR cluster with Spark for large-scale processing
- **Database:** RDS PostgreSQL with PostGIS for spatial queries
- **Orchestration:** AWS Step Functions or Apache Airflow for pipeline management
- **Visualization:** QuickSight or custom web app with Leaflet/Mapbox

### 10. Potential Enhancements
- **Machine Learning:** Train a CNN for more accurate deforestation detection
- **Real-time Processing:** Implement streaming for near-real-time alerts
- **Multi-source Integration:** Combine with weather data, fire alerts, etc.
- **Web Dashboard:** Build interactive visualization with Dash or Streamlit
- **Advanced Change Detection:** Implement CCDC (Continuous Change Detection and Classification)

This project provides a comprehensive framework for satellite data processing with Spark that you can adapt to your specific needs. The modular design allows for customization of each component while maintaining a scalable architecture.
